# Shogi Game

# Overview
Welcome to the `Console Based Shogi Game` project! This is a C++ implementation of the traditional Japanese board game, Shogi. Shogi, also known as Japanese chess, is a two-player strategy game that offers deep strategic gameplay with its unique set of rules and piece movements.

# Features
- Full Shogi Rules Implementation: Experience the authentic gameplay of Shogi with all its traditional rules.
- Command-Line Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for seamless gameplay.
- Piece Movement and Capture Mechanics: Accurate simulation of piece movements and capture mechanics.
- Visual Board Display: Clear text-based board display to easily follow the game state.
- Pieces Legalities: When a player clicks a piece, all legal moves for that piece are highlighted. If another piece is clicked, the previously highlighted blocks are unhighlighted. This feature helps players see possible moves and strategize better.
- Game State Saving: The game automatically saves the last played game state in a file named text1.txt, allowing you to resume your game from where you left off.

# Files
- **Shogi Game.cpp**: The main source code file containing the implementation of the Shogi game.
- **text.txt**: A sample file showcasing the representation of a Shogi game state.
- **text1.txt**: File where the last played game state is saved.

# Game State Representation
- The text.txt file includes an example of the Shogi board state.
- The text1.txt file saves the last played game state, allowing you to continue your game from the last move made.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
## Compilation
Compile the Shogi game on your compiler.
## Running the Game
After compiling, you can start the game by running it.

## Gameplay
Upon starting the game, you'll be prompted to input moves for each player alternately. The board will be displayed in the terminal after each move, showing the updated game state. The game continues until one player achieves checkmate.
